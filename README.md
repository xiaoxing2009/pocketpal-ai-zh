# PocketPal AI üì±üöÄ

PocketPal AI is a pocket-sized AI assistant powered by small language models (SLMs) that run directly on your phone. Designed for both iOS and Android, PocketPal AI lets you interact with various SLMs without the need for an internet connection. Your privacy is fully protected as all processing happens entirely on-device ‚Äî your conversations, prompts, and data never leave your phone or get stored on external servers.

> **Note on Privacy**: The only data that may leave your device is what you explicitly choose to share: benchmark results (if you opt to contribute to the leaderboard) and any feedback you voluntarily submit through the app.

### Copying Text

- **Copy Entire Response**: Tap the copy icon at the bottom of the AI's response bubble.
- **Copy Specific Paragraph**: Long-press on a paragraph to copy its content.

*Note*: Preserving text formatting while copying is currently limited. We're working on improving this feature.

### Message Editing

2. After editing, the AI will regenerate its response based on your changes.
3. Use the retry option to get a new response without changing your message.
4. You can also retry generation using a different model for comparison or better results.

### Using Pals

1. Create personalized AI assistants with different personalities and settings.
2. PocketPal offers two different pal types:
   - **Assistant Pal**: Select a default model, set a system prompt (manually or generated by another AI), and customize chat text input color.
   - **Roleplay Pal**: Similar to Assistant Pal plus additional settings for location, AI's role, and other contextual parameters.
3. Select a Pal using the Pal picker in the chat page to quickly switch between different personas.
